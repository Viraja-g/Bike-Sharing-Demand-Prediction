General Information
	•	Background: This project focuses on understanding and predicting the factors influencing bike demand in a shared bike system. It aims to help urban planners and bike-sharing companies optimize resource allocation and improve user satisfaction.
	•	Business Problem: The main objective is to identify the key factors affecting bike demand and create a predictive model to estimate daily bike rentals. This insight can aid in strategic decision-making, such as fleet management and marketing campaigns.
	•	Dataset: The dataset contains daily bike rental counts along with associated meteorological and calendar information, such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, season, weather conditions, and whether the day is a holiday or a working day.

Conclusions
	•	Conclusion 1: Weather conditions significantly affect bike demand, with clear or partly cloudy weather leading to higher rentals. Light adverse weather conditions also showed a surprising positive contribution to demand.
	•	Conclusion 2: Year-over-year trends indicate a growing preference for bike-sharing systems, with the year 2019 seeing higher demand compared to 2018.
	•	Conclusion 3: Temperature is the strongest numerical predictor of bike demand, with higher temperatures correlating positively with increased usage.
	•	Conclusion 4: Categorical variables like season and month highlight seasonal trends, with summer and fall showing peak demands. Holidays generally see lower demand compared to working days.

Technologies Used
